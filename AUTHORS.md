Blackeye 2.0 was originally created by J-dogcoder in late 2020 as a modified version of blackeye.
You can find the information on the oringinal project [here.](https://github.com/x3rz/blackeye)
    
We'd also like to thank all the people who reported bugs, helped
answer questions, and generally made blackeye better.
